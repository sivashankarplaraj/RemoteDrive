# Project diagrams

This folder contains high-level diagrams for the Django-based cloud storage PoC.

- Architecture overview: `architecture-overview.md`
- Upload flow sequence: `sequence-upload.md`
- Data model (ER): `data-model.md`
- Deployment/topology: `deployment.md`

Notes
- Diagrams are written in Mermaid. Many Markdown renderers (including GitHub) support Mermaid. In VS Code, you can preview these Markdown files and render the diagrams.
- The scope targets a minimal PoC with Django API, MinIO (S3-compatible), and a simple metadata DB.
