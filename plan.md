### High-level roadmap - Cloud Storage Solutions

## Phase 0: Requirements & Architecture
1. Define scope / MVP features
    - E.g. user sign-up / log in, upload/download, file listing, share link
    - Maybe only web + CLI client initially
2.	Design system architecture
    - Draw component diagrams, data flows, failure modes
    - Choose stack (tech)
3.	Design data models
    - Users, files, directories, versions, shares, quotas
4.	Design APIs (REST, versions)

## Phase 1: Core backend & storage
1. Set up storage backend (e.g. MinIO / Ceph / S3)
2. Build metadata DB schema
3. Implement API endpoints: upload, download, list, delete, move/rename
4. Handle authentication / authorization
5. Basic web UI (file browser)

## Phase 2: Advanced features
1. Versioning (previous versions, rollback)
2. File sharing / public links / permissions
3. Large file uploads (chunking, resumable uploads)
4. Sync / client: build a CLI client for sync operations
5. Performance optimizations, caching

## Phase 3: Mount / Drive support & clients
1. Build a FUSE / file system driver for Linux/macOS
2. Windows integration (Dokany / WinFSP)
3. Handle offline changes, conflict resolution
4. Mobile clients

## Phase 4: Security, reliability, scale
1. Encryption (in transit TLS, at rest, optional client-side encryption)
2. Backup, replication, redundancy
3. Monitoring, logging, alerting
4. Autoscaling, sharding, multi-region deployment
5. Rate limiting, abuse prevention
6. Billing / subscription (if commercial)

## Phase 5: Polishing & extra features
1. Search (full-text, metadata)
2. File previews, thumbnails, image / video transcoding
3. Collaboration (comments, shared editing pointers)
4. Audit logs, analytics, usage dashboards
5. Integrations (third-party APIs, connectors)
