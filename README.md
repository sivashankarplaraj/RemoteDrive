# Project diagrams

This folder contains high-level diagrams for the Django-based cloud storage PoC.

- [Architecture overview](docx/architecture-overview.md)
- [Upload flow sequence](docx/sequence-upload.md)
- [Data model (ER)](docx/data-model.md)
- [Deployment/topology](docx/deployment.md)

Notes
- Diagrams are written in Mermaid. Many Markdown renderers (including GitHub) support Mermaid. In VS Code, you can preview these Markdown files and render the diagrams.
- The scope targets a minimal PoC with Django API, MinIO (S3-compatible), and a simple metadata DB.
